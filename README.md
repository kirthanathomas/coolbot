# My cool bot

This is an experiment to learn more about node.js, IBM watson, slack bots and git. The final objective is to have a bot that does one task well and is hence usable.

1. Install the dependencies

    ```
    npm install
    ```

2. Add your Slack token and Watson Assistant credentials to `.env`

3. Start the app

    ```
    npm start
    ```
